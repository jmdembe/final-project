# iFeel
iFeel is my capstone project for The Iron Yard Front-End Engineering course in December 2016-January 2017. iFeel is an app that seeks to use technology in change health behaviors in regards to mental health. iFeel was designed to be easily adapted for users of all ages, reading levels, and disability.

This app is an anxiety and depression management tool to help users track their mood as well as document reasons in mood changes. This tool can aid in the management of depression with a board certified medical professional.
